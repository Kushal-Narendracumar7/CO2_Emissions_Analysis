# CO₂ Emissions Analysis

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project analyzes **CO₂ emissions** data to understand global emission trends, key contributors, and their impact on the environment. Using **Power BI**, the dataset is visualized through interactive dashboards, helping in data-driven decision-making for sustainability and policy planning.

## 📚 Dataset Details

The dataset includes information on **CO₂ emissions** across different years, categorized by:
- **Region/Country**
- **Industrial Growth**
- **Transportation Sector Impact**
- **Urbanization Trends**
- **Total Emissions Over Time**

## 💪 Technologies Used

- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** (Power Query in Power BI)
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For advanced calculations and insights

## 📊 Key Insights from the Power BI Dashboard

- **Yearly CO₂ Emission Trends** – Tracking emission changes over time.
- **Regional Comparisons** – Identifying high-emission and low-emission regions.
- **Sector-Wise Contribution** – Understanding the role of industries, transportation, and urbanization in emissions.
- **Correlation Analysis** – Exploring relationships between economic activities and CO₂ levels.

## 🚀 How to Use the Dashboard

1. Open **CO2_Emissions_Report.pbix** in Power BI.
2. Explore interactive visualizations, filters, and slicers.
3. Analyze different aspects of CO₂ emissions using trend charts, maps, and comparison tools.
